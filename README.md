# CDMD-NODE

This is development code of **stochastic neural ordinary differential equation - Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CDMD-NODE)**.  
The project explores uncertainty-aware neural ODEs for dynamic mode decomposition with applications to complex dynamical systems.

## 🛠 Environment Setup

We recommend using **conda**:

```bash
conda create -n node_dmd python=3.10
conda activate node_dmd
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚡ GPU Support (PyTorch)

By default `requirements.txt` installs the CPU version of PyTorch.  
If you want GPU acceleration, install PyTorch matching your CUDA version.

For CUDA 12.1:
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

For CUDA 11.8:
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Train model
```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluate (autoregressive rollout and teacher forcing rollout)
```bash
python eval.py
```


## 📌 Notes
